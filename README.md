List of commands in Commands.txt. That is somewhat psudocode and not meant to be direct bnf code.
(.mpl means "my programming language". Just wanted some extention)
Example1.mpi is a simple fib function that prints Fib(n).
Example2.mpi creates a grid of boxes.

I have not spent much time to perfect this and would like recommendations/improvements, or
you could create your own idea if you want. I would like to do the GUI part at least.
It is very likely that I have missed/overlooked something. The examples may have an error
or we may need to add to the commands. We can discuss this Friday.
