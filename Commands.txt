General Idea:
	1. Looks similar to english
	2. Designed to be GUI based. Prints are largely for testing
	3. Start at first function (All code is inside a function to make things easy) (First function gets command args)

Built in types:
	int, double, string, bool

Variables (Auto typeing/declaring?):
	Set an <type> called <Var> to <expr>.				# Will create the var if it does not exist, or find it if it does (Also consider var to var)
	Set a global <type> called <Var> to <expr>.			# Globals are accessed anywhere (Top of file)
		Ex: "Set an integer called Pie to 5+8."

Comments:
	# This is a line Comment
	/* Multiline comment */ 
	
Expr:
	Lets more or less copy javas expresions.

Conditional:
	if <expr> is <expr>, then: <CompoundStmt> Leave the if statement.
		Ex: "if 4+8 is 9+3 then: Set an interger called hi to 9. Leave the if statement."

Loops:
	While <expr> is true: <CompoundStmt> Exit the while.
		Ex: "While hi > 0 is true: Set an integer called hi to hi - 1. Exit the while."
	
Console:
	Print <expr> to the console.

Function:
	Begin a function called <var> [with type <type> called <Var> [{, type <type> <Var>} and type <type> called <Var] ].			# First function is main()
	Call the function <function>  [with <Var> [{, <Var>} and <Var] ].
	Return <Var> to the caller.
	Leave the function.
	Ex: "Begin a function called Fib with type int called N.
	Ex: "Begin a function called Foo with type int called Pie, type bool called Hello, and type string called Str.

GUI:
	Create a Box called <Var>						# Same for Circle, line, and text
	Move <Var> to <expr> and <expr> 				# x and y pos
	Set the size of Circle <Var> to <expr>			# Radius
	Set the size of Box <Var> to <expr> and <expr>	# Width, height
	Set the color of <Var> to <Color>				# Hex or some premade colors?
	If <Box> is clicked call function <function>	# Lets do Evenets!
	Remove <var> from the canvas.					# Boxes are auto added, but may be removed

	Built in function "Gameloop" that is automatically called every frame (60fps?)
	This is optional, but important to allow movement in the GUI, so adding
	"Begin a function called Gameloop." is a special case
