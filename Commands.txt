General Idea:
	1. Looks similar to english
	2. Designed to be GUI based. Prints are largely for testing
	3. Start at first function (All code is inside a function to make things easy) (First function gets command args)

Built in types:
	int, double, string, bool

Variables (Auto typeing/declaring?):
	Set <Var> to <expr>.				# Will create the var if it does not exist, or find it if it does (Also consider var to var)
	Set global <Var> to <expr>.			# Globals are accessed anywhere (Top of file)
		Ex: "Set Pie to 5+8."

Comments:
	# This is a line Comment
	/* Multiline comment */ 
	
Expr:
	Lets more or less copy javas expresions.

Conditional:
	if <expr> is <expr>, then: <CompoundStmt> Leave the if statement.
		Ex: "if 4+8 is 9+3 then: Set an interger called hi to 9. Leave the if statement."

Loops:
	While <expr> is true: <CompoundStmt> Exit the while.
		Ex: "While hi > 0 is true: Set an integer called hi to hi - 1. Exit the while."
	
Console:
	Print <expr> to the console.

Function:
	Begin a function called <var> [with type <type> called <Var> [{, type <type> <Var>} and type <type> called <Var] ].			# First function is main()
	Call the function <function>  [with <Var> [{, <Var>} and <Var] ].
	Return <Var> to the caller.
	Leave the function.
	Ex: "Begin a function called Fib with type int called N.
	Ex: "Begin a function called Foo with type int called Pie, type bool called Hello, and type string called Str.

Lists:
	(Lists also use implied types, no need to declare them, just add a value to a list and it will be created)
	Add <expr> to <Var>.
	Remove <expr> from <Var>.
	Remove index <int> from <Var>.
	index <int> of <list>				(In an expression)
	length of <list>					(In an expression)
	Ex: "Add 5 to MyList."
	Ex: "Remove 5 from MyList."
	Ex: "Remove index 2 from MyList."
	Ex: "Set myVar to index 2 of MyList."
	Ex: "Set myVar to index 2 of MyList + 2 / 7."
	Ex: "Set myVar to length of MyList."
	Ex: "Set myVar to length of MyList + 2 / 7."

GUI:
	Create a [global] <GUI Object> called <Var>.	# Same for Circle, line, and text
	Move <Var> to <expr> and <expr>.				# x and y pos
	Remove <var> from the canvas.					# All GUI objects are auto added. This is to remove them.
	Set the color of <Var> to (r, g, b, a).			# Specify color

	# The function can have no parameters
	# Or it can have one parameter of the correct GUI type
	When <Var> is clicked, call <function>.			

	// Circle
	Set the radius of Circle <Var> to <expr>		# Radius

	// Box
	Set the size of Box <Var> to <expr> and <expr>	# Width, height

	// Line
	Set the chords of <Var> to (<expr>, <expr>) and (<expr>, <expr>).
	Set the size of <Var> to <expr>.				# Thickness

	// Text
	Set the text of <Var> to <expr>.				# Text
	Set the size of <Var> to <expr>.				# Font size
	

	Built in function "Gameloop" that is automatically called every frame (60fps?)
	This is optional, but important to allow movement in the GUI, so adding
	"Begin a function called Gameloop." is a special case
